# Corona-virus-probability-of-infection
In this machine learning  repository, i had trained a model from the original data in which the train data contains the details of persons and their infected probability as the target variable, the test data contains all the data of training data set expect the infected probability which is needed to be predicted after training the model.I have used the Ordered least squares algorithm for training and testing the data.Using the Exploratory data Analysis and feature engineering i came up the dependent variables and used them for predicting the infected probability of the test data.
